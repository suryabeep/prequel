            Case Study
          </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <h4>About the Client</h4>
          <p>
            The client is amongst the top 10 global automobile companies and is the world’s largest manufacturer of motorcycles and internal combustion engines 
            with a market cap of $48 billion as of Sep 2020. The Indian subsidiary of the client is India’s 2nd largest 2-wheeler manufacturer with a customer 
            base in excess of 46 million and has 4 manufacturing units with a production capacity of 6.5 million units/annum
          </p>
          <h4>Business Problem</h4>
          <p>
            The client has ambitious digitalization plans for its Indian subsidiary. The company’s leadership is keen on leveraging new-age technologies 
            like artificial intelligence (AI), Machine learning (ML) & big data in planning function and towards creating data/data science-driven 
            decision-making frameworks. 
            <br><br>The company was previously using spreadsheets to plan operations and had dedicated teams for planning optimization
            across different functions (5-6 mid-level planning resources per function). But to truly implement the digital agenda, they needed to shift 
            towards a scalable and agile solution that could understand their environment, rules/constraints and thereby create optimized planning in sync 
            with them. 
            <br><br>As dispatch planning was an area where the client was facing problems due to complexities in the planning environment leading to 
            higher freight cost & lower sales fulfillment, they wanted to test the efficacy of AI solutions in the dispatch domain. These complexities were: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Multiple variables: 250 SKUs (models, variants, colors), 1000+ dealers, 8 stock points (plant and regional W/H), 14-day dispatches.</li>
            <li>Environmental  constraints:  limitations  in  transportation  (fixed  carrier  capacity,  order  interchange rules for safety stock) and scheduling (FTLs/LTLs, stock availability).</li> 
            <li>Uncertainties: internal process linked (payment probability, sales order changes), external environment linked (weather, political, operational etc.).</li>
            <li>Processes: Payment clearance, stock transfers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There were three objective criteria for optimizing:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>100% order fulfillment</li>
            <li>Minimum freight cost</li>
            <li>Even spread of dispatches through the planning cycle</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            Iterative data modeling coupled with propriety self-learning AI algorithms of VERDIS delivered an optimized dispatch plan. 
            <br>Multi-stage simulations generated best-fit plans (mapping 150 million possible nodes) adhering to boundaries and constraints of the sales requirement (OTIF).
          </p>
          <h4>Results</h4>
          <p>
            The VERDIS solution was observed and compared with the manual planning team’s output over six dispatch planning cycles (Jan to March 20) 
            & the following emerged:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Savings of 16.5% freight cost/unit</li>
            <li>More than 80% reduction in time and effort to prepare dispatch plan</li>
            <li>100% stock allocation for dispatch for sales fulfillment</li>
            <li>Extraneous uncertainties were incorporated/factored in planning.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Current Status</h4>
          <p>
            The dispatch planning is now being done entirely by VERDIS. The planning output is validated by 1 resource. The dispatch planning module’s 
            success has resulted in the client starting to use VERDIS for production planning as well. 
            <br><br>The CXO dashboards and BI tools work in a very intuitive, easy to use manner and MIS, reports & BI is being delivered over e-mail to 
            the CXO’s across functions
